# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Strategy

## 🌍 Executive Summary

This document outlines our strategic approach to multi-cloud infrastructure, enabling resilient, cost-effective, and scalable deployments across AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

## 🎯 Why Multi-Cloud?

### Strategic Benefits

1. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Eliminates single point of failure at the cloud provider level
   - Reduces vendor lock-in and increases negotiating power
   - Ensures business continuity during provider outages

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Leverage competitive pricing across providers
   - Use each cloud's cost-effective services for specific workloads
   - Optimize data transfer and egress costs

3. **Performance & Compliance**
   - Deploy closer to end users using multiple cloud regions
   - Meet data residency requirements in different jurisdictions
   - Leverage best-in-class services from each provider

4. **Innovation Acceleration**
   - Access cutting-edge services from all major providers
   - Avoid waiting for feature parity across clouds
   - Experiment with new technologies without full commitment

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Provider-Centric Organization
```
terraform/
├── providers/
│   ├── aws/           # Amazon Web Services
│   ├── gcp/           # Google Cloud Platform
│   └── azure/         # Microsoft Azure
├── modules/           # Reusable, cloud-agnostic modules
└── shared/            # Cross-cloud configuration
```

### Layered Infrastructure Approach

1. **Foundation Layer (01-foundation)**
   - VPC/Network setup
   - Security groups and firewalls
   - VPN connections

2. **Platform Layer (02-platform)**
   - Kubernetes clusters (EKS/GKE/AKS)
   - Container orchestration
   - Service mesh setup

3. **Database Layer (03-databases)**
   - Managed and self-hosted databases
   - Backup and recovery systems
   - Cross-region replication

4. **Observability Layer (03.5-observability)**
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Distributed tracing
   - Alerting systems

5. **Application Layer (04-applications)**
   - Client-specific deployments
   - Microservices
   - Load balancing

6. **Shared Services Layer (06-shared-services)**
   - CI/CD systems
   - Security services
   - Governance tools

## 🌐 Regional Strategy

### Current Deployments
- **Primary**: AWS AF-South-1 (Cape Town)
- **Secondary**: AWS US-East-1 (N. Virginia)
- **Planned**: GCP Europe-West1, Azure West-Europe

### Regional Selection Criteria
1. **Proximity to users** - Minimize latency
2. **Data residency** - Comply with local regulations
3. **Service availability** - Ensure required services are available
4. **Cost effectiveness** - Balance performance with costs
5. **Disaster recovery** - Geographic distribution for resilience

## 🔧 Implementation Patterns

### Cloud-Agnostic Modules
Our modules abstract cloud-specific implementations:
```hcl
module "kubernetes_cluster" {
  source = "../../modules/kubernetes-platform"
  
  provider_type = "aws"  # or "gcp", "azure"
  region       = var.region
  # ... unified interface regardless of cloud
}
```

### Consistent Naming Convention
- **Projects**: `{region}-{purpose}-{environment}` (e.g., `cptwn-eks-01`)
- **Resources**: `{project}-{component}-{instance}` (e.g., `cptwn-eks-01-vpc`)
- **Tags**: Standardized across all clouds for cost allocation

### Infrastructure as Code Best Practices
- **Immutable infrastructure** - Replace, don't modify
- **Version controlled** - All changes tracked in Git
- **Automated deployment** - CI/CD pipelines for consistency
- **Environment parity** - Dev/staging mirrors production

## 📊 Cost Management Strategy

### Resource Tagging Strategy
Every resource includes standardized tags:
```hcl
tags = {
  Project         = "cptwn-eks-01"
  Environment     = "production"
  ManagedBy       = "terraform"
  CostCenter      = "infrastructure"
  BusinessUnit    = "platform"
  Owner           = "platform-team"
  CriticalInfra   = "true"
}
```

### Cost Optimization Techniques
1. **Right-sizing** - Regular review of resource utilization
2. **Reserved instances** - Commitment pricing for predictable workloads
3. **Spot instances** - Cost-effective compute for fault-tolerant workloads
4. **Auto-scaling** - Dynamic resource allocation
5. **Cross-cloud arbitrage** - Leverage pricing differences

## 🛡️ Security & Governance

### Security Principles
1. **Zero trust architecture** - Verify every connection
2. **Defense in depth** - Multiple security layers
3. **Principle of least privilege** - Minimal required access
4. **Encryption everywhere** - Data at rest and in transit

### Governance Framework
- **Policy as Code** - Automated compliance checking
- **Access controls** - Role-based permissions
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Regular reviews** - Security and cost assessments
