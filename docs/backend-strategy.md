# Terraform Backend Configuration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the backend configuration strategy for the scalable Terraform architecture, providing state isolation between environments, layers, and clients while maintaining operational excellence.

## Current State Management Challenges

### Existing Issues
- Single monolithic state file for all resources
- No environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- No layer isolation (foundation/platform/database/clients)
- Longer plan/apply times due to large state
- Risk of resource conflicts
- Limited team collaboration capabilities

## Proposed Backend Strategy

### 1. State File Organization

#### Hierarchical State Structure
```
terraform-state-bucket/
├── environments/
│   ├── production/
│   │   ├── us-east-1/
│   │   │   ├── 01-foundation/terraform.tfstate
│   │   │   ├── 02-platform/terraform.tfstate
│   │   │   ├── 03-databases/terraform.tfstate
│   │   │   ├── 04-applications/terraform.tfstate
│   │   │   └── clients/
│   │   │       ├── mtn-ghana/terraform.tfstate
│   │   │       └── ezra/terraform.tfstate
│   │   └── us-west-2/ (future expansion)
│   ├── staging/
│   │   └── us-east-1/
│   │       ├── 01-foundation/terraform.tfstate
│   │       ├── 02-platform/terraform.tfstate
│   │       └── clients/
│   └── development/
│       └── us-east-1/
│           ├── 01-foundation/terraform.tfstate
│           └── 02-platform/terraform.tfstate
```

#### State File Naming Convention
- **Pattern**: `{environment}/{region}/{layer|client}/{terraform.tfstate}`
- **Examples**:
  - Foundation: `production/us-east-1/01-foundation/terraform.tfstate`
  - Client: `production/us-east-1/clients/mtn-ghana/terraform.tfstate`

### 2. Backend Configuration Files

#### Environment-Specific Backends
Each environment uses its own backend configuration:

- `shared/backend-configs/production.hcl`
- `shared/backend-configs/staging.hcl`
- `shared/backend-configs/development.hcl`

#### Layer-Specific Key Management
Each layer/client directory specifies its state key:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # Common settings loaded from backend config file
    # Key specified per layer/client
  }
}
```

### 3. State Locking Strategy

#### DynamoDB Table Structure
- **Production**: `terraform-locks-production`
- **Staging**: `terraform-locks-staging`
- **Development**: `terraform-locks-development`

#### Lock Key Format
- **Pattern**: `{bucket-name}/{state-key}`
- **Example**: `usest1-terraform-state-ezra/production/us-east-1/01-foundation/terraform.tfstate`

### 4. Workspace Strategy (Alternative Approach)

#### When to Use Workspaces vs Separate Backends

**Use Separate Backends For:**
- Different environments (production/staging/development)
- Different AWS accounts
- Different regions
- Complete resource isolation needed

**Use Workspaces For:**
- Testing configurations in same environment
- Feature branch testing
- Client-specific deployments within same environment
- Development iterations

#### Workspace Naming Convention
- **Pattern**: `{client}-{feature|version}`
- **Examples**:
  - `mtn-ghana-v1`
  - `ezra-testing`
  - `default` (main client configuration)

### 5. Implementation Examples

#### Foundation Layer Backend
```hcl
# In regions/us-east-1/layers/01-foundation/production/backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # Load from backend config
  }
}
```

#### Client-Specific Backend
```hcl
# In regions/us-east-1/clients/mtn-ghana/production/backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    key = "production/us-east-1/clients/mtn-ghana/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

## Benefits of New Strategy

### State Isolation Benefits
1. **Faster Operations**: Smaller state files = faster plans/applies
2. **Reduced Risk**: Layer isolation prevents accidental resource modification
3. **Team Independence**: Teams can work on different layers simultaneously
4. **Environment Safety**: Complete isolation between prod/staging/dev

### Operational Benefits
1. **Targeted Deployments**: Deploy only specific layers or clients
2. **Easier Rollbacks**: Rollback specific layers without affecting others
3. **Better Debugging**: Smaller state files easier to troubleshoot
4. **Improved Security**: Layer-specific access controls possible

### Scalability Benefits
1. **Multi-Region Support**: Easy expansion to additional regions
2. **Client Onboarding**: Simple addition of new clients
3. **Layer Evolution**: Independent versioning and evolution per layer
4. **Resource Management**: Better resource organization and tracking

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend Setup (Week 1)
1. Create new S3 bucket structure
2. Set up DynamoDB tables for locking
3. Configure IAM policies per environment
4. Test backend configurations

### Phase 2: Foundation Migration (Week 2)
1. Create foundation layer directory structure
2. Import VPC and networking resources to foundation state
3. Test state operations and locking
4. Validate foundation layer deployment

### Phase 3: Platform Migration (Week 3)
1. Create platform layer directory structure
2. Import EKS cluster and shared services
3. Configure cross-layer dependencies
4. Test platform layer operations

### Phase 4: Client Separation (Week 4-5)
1. Create client-specific directories
2. Import client resources to isolated states
3. Configure client-specific backends
4. Test client isolation and operations

### Phase 5: Validation and Cleanup (Week 6)
1. Full integration testing
2. Performance validation
3. Team training on new structure
4. Cleanup old state files

## Security and Access Control

### IAM Strategy
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/TerraformFoundationRole" },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::terraform-state-bucket/production/*/01-foundation/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Role-Based Access
- **Foundation Team**: Access to foundation layer states only
- **Platform Team**: Access to platform and application layers
- **Client Teams**: Access to their specific client states
- **Ops Team**: Read access to all states for monitoring

### Encryption Strategy
- **At Rest**: S3 bucket encryption enabled
- **In Transit**: TLS encryption for all operations
- **State Files**: Sensitive values marked appropriately
- **DynamoDB**: Encryption enabled for lock tables

## Monitoring and Alerting

### State File Monitoring
- State file modification alerts
- Lock acquisition/release tracking
- Backend operation metrics
- Error rate monitoring per layer

### Operational Metrics
- Plan/apply duration per layer
- State file size growth
- Lock contention metrics
- Backend availability

### Automated Checks
- State file integrity validation
- Cross-layer dependency validation
- Drift detection per layer
- Backup verification

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**: Use local backend for initial development
2. **Testing**: Use workspace or dedicated testing backend
3. **Staging**: Deploy to staging environment first
4. **Production**: Deploy with proper approvals and monitoring

### State Management
1. **Regular Backups**: Automated state backup to separate bucket
2. **Version Control**: State file versioning enabled
3. **Access Logging**: CloudTrail logging for all state operations
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Automated cleanup of old state versions

### Operational Procedures
1. **State Recovery**: Documented procedures for state recovery
2. **Lock Recovery**: Automated and manual lock recovery procedures
3. **Migration**: Procedures for layer-to-layer resource migration
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region state replication strategy
