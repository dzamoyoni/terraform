## 🏗️ Architecture-Aware CI/CD Design

### **Leveraging Our Layered Architecture**

Our **4-layer architecture** enables unprecedented CI/CD efficiency:

```yaml
Layer Dependencies & Parallel Execution:
├── Layer 01 (Foundation) ──┐
├── Layer 02 (Platform) ────┼──> Independent execution paths
├── Layer 03 (Databases) ───┤   > Parallel client deployments  
└── Layer 04 (Applications) ─┘   > Layer-specific validation
```

**Key Advantages:**
- ✅ **Parallel Deployments** - Different layers can deploy simultaneously
- ✅ **Selective Updates** - Only deploy changed components
- ✅ **Blast Radius Control** - Issues isolated to specific layers
- ✅ **Fast Feedback Loops** - Layer-specific testing and validation

### **Branch Strategy**
```yaml
Branch Model: Environment-based with feature branches

main (production):
  Auto-deploys to: production environments
  Requires: 2+ approvals, all checks passing
  Protection: Branch protection rules, status checks

staging:
  Auto-deploys to: staging environments  
  Requires: 1 approval, automated tests passing
  Purpose: Pre-production validation

develop:
  Auto-deploys to: development environments
  Requires: Basic validation only
  Purpose: Feature development and testing

feature/* branches:
  Triggers: Plan-only (no deployments)
  Purpose: Development and review
```
