# FinOps & Cost Management Strategy

## 💰 Executive Summary

This document outlines our Financial Operations (FinOps) strategy for multi-cloud infrastructure, focusing on cost optimization, budget control, and financial accountability across AWS, GCP, and Azure deployments.

## 🎯 FinOps Principles

### Core Tenets
1. **Transparency**: Real-time visibility into cloud spending
2. **Accountability**: Clear cost ownership and allocation
3. **Optimization**: Continuous improvement of cost efficiency
4. **Governance**: Automated policies to prevent cost overruns

## 🏷️ Resource Tagging Strategy

### Mandatory Tags
Every resource must include these standardized tags for cost allocation:

```hcl
tags = {
  # Financial Accountability
  Project         = "cptwn-eks-01"           # Project identifier
  Environment     = "production"             # Environment (prod/staging/dev)
  CostCenter      = "infrastructure"         # Billing department
  BusinessUnit    = "platform"               # Business unit
  Owner           = "platform-team"          # Team responsible
  
  # Operational Context  
  ManagedBy       = "terraform"              # Management tool
  Region          = "af-south-1"             # Geographic location
  Layer           = "foundation"             # Infrastructure layer
  CriticalInfra   = "true"                  # Business criticality
  
  # Governance
  BackupRequired  = "true"                  # Backup policy
  SecurityLevel   = "high"                  # Security classification
  DataClass       = "restricted"           # Data sensitivity
  ComplianceReq   = "gdpr,pci"             # Compliance requirements
}
```

### Tag Governance
- **Automated Enforcement**: Terraform validates required tags
- **Missing Tag Alerts**: CloudWatch/Stackdriver alerts for untagged resources
- **Cost Allocation Reports**: Automated monthly reports by tag dimensions
- **Tag Standardization**: Centralized tag dictionaries and validation

## 📊 Cost Visibility & Monitoring

### Real-Time Dashboards

#### Executive Dashboard
- **Monthly Spend Trend**: Current vs. previous months
- **Budget vs. Actual**: Real-time budget tracking
- **Top Cost Drivers**: Services consuming most budget
- **Multi-Cloud Comparison**: Cost distribution across providers

#### Operational Dashboard
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, storage usage
- **Idle Resources**: Underutilized or unused resources
- **Cost per Client**: Individual client cost breakdown
- **Regional Spend**: Geographic cost distribution

### Automated Reporting
```hcl
# Cost anomaly detection
resource "aws_ce_anomaly_detector" "main" {
  name         = "infrastructure-anomaly-detector"
  monitor_type = "DIMENSIONAL"

  monitor_specification {
    dimension_key           = "SERVICE"
    match_options          = ["EQUALS"]
    values                 = ["Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute"]
    dimension_key          = "LINKED_ACCOUNT"
    match_options          = ["EQUALS"] 
    values                 = [data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id]
  }
}

# Budget alerts
resource "aws_budgets_budget" "infrastructure" {
  name         = "infrastructure-monthly-budget"
  budget_type  = "COST"
  limit_amount = "5000"
  limit_unit   = "USD"
  time_unit    = "MONTHLY"
  
  cost_filters {
    tag {
      key    = "Project"
      values = ["cptwn-eks-01"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Right-Sizing Resources

#### Compute Optimization
- **Instance Analysis**: Weekly reviews of CPU/memory utilization
- **Automated Resizing**: Lambda functions to resize underutilized instances
- **Instance Type Recommendations**: ML-powered suggestions for optimal sizing

#### Storage Optimization
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic transition to cheaper storage tiers
- **Unused Volume Detection**: Identify and remove orphaned EBS volumes
- **Compression**: Enable compression on applicable storage services

### 2. Commitment-Based Discounts

#### Reserved Instances (AWS)
```hcl
# Reserved Instance recommendations
locals {
  ri_recommendations = {
    "m5.large"  = { quantity = 10, term = "1year", payment = "partial" }
    "r5.xlarge" = { quantity = 5,  term = "3year", payment = "all"     }
  }
}
```

#### Committed Use Discounts (GCP)
- **1-year commitments**: For predictable workloads
- **3-year commitments**: Maximum discount for stable infrastructure
- **Flexible commitments**: Regional flexibility for dynamic workloads

#### Reserved Instances (Azure)
- **Reserved VM Instances**: Up to 72% savings
- **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: License portability savings
- **Spot VM instances**: Up to 90% discount for interruptible workloads

### 3. Dynamic Resource Management

#### Auto-Scaling Policies
```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "scale_up" {
  name                   = "scale-up-policy"
  scaling_adjustment     = 2
  adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
  cooldown              = 300
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.main.name
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "scale_down" {
  name                   = "scale-down-policy" 
  scaling_adjustment     = -1
  adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
  cooldown              = 300
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.main.name
}
```

#### Schedule-Based Scaling
- **Development environments**: Shut down outside business hours
- **Staging environments**: Scale to zero during weekends
- **Testing environments**: On-demand activation only

### 4. Spot/Preemptible Instances

#### Implementation Strategy
```hcl
# Mixed instance types for resilience and cost savings
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "mixed" {
  mixed_instances_policy {
    instances_distribution {
      on_demand_base_capacity                  = 2
      on_demand_percentage_above_base_capacity = 20
      spot_allocation_strategy                 = "capacity-optimized"
    }
    
    launch_template {
      launch_template_specification {
        launch_template_id = aws_launch_template.main.id
        version           = "$Latest"
      }
      
      override {
        instance_type     = "m5.large"
        weighted_capacity = "1"
      }
      
      override {
        instance_type     = "m5a.large"
        weighted_capacity = "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
