# Multi-Cloud Terraform Infrastructure

**Enterprise-grade multi-cloud infrastructure** built with Terraform for scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## Quick Start for New Team Members

1. **[ Team Onboarding Guide](docs/TEAM_ONBOARDING.md)** - Complete setup and your first deployment
2. **[ Multi-Cloud Strategy](docs/MULTI_CLOUD_STRATEGY.md)** - Understand our architectural approach  
3. **[ Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - How to deploy and scale infrastructure
4. **[ FinOps & Cost Management](docs/FINOPS_COST_MANAGEMENT.md)** - Cost optimization strategies

## Architecture Overview

Our infrastructure follows a **provider-centric, multi-cloud architecture**:

```
terraform/
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/                  # Cloud provider deployments
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws/                   # Amazon Web Services
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modules/           # AWS-specific modules
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ regions/           # Regional deployments
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ af-south-1/    # Cape Town (Primary)
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ us-east-1/     # N. Virginia (Secondary) 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gcp/                   # Google Cloud Platform (Planned)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ azure/                 # Microsoft Azure (Planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/                   # Cloud-agnostic reusable modules
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                    # Cross-cloud configuration
â””â”€â”€ docs/                      # Comprehensive documentation
```

### Layered Deployment Strategy

Each region deploys infrastructure in logical layers:

1. **Backend Setup** - Terraform state management (S3 + DynamoDB)
2. **Foundation (01)** - VPC, subnets, security groups, VPN
3. **Platform (02)** - EKS clusters, node groups, service accounts
4. **Databases (03)** - PostgreSQL instances, backup systems
5. **Observability (03.5)** - Monitoring, logging, distributed tracing
6. **Shared Services (06)** - Load balancers, DNS, cluster services

### Multi-Cloud Roadmap

- **Q1**: AWS foundation complete (af-south-1, us-east-1)
- **Q2**: GCP expansion (europe-west1)
- **Q3**: Azure integration (westeurope)
- **Q4**: Advanced cross-cloud orchestration

## Key Features

### **Multi-Cloud Ready**
- Consistent architecture across AWS, GCP, Azure
- Provider-agnostic modules for portability
- Unified cost management and governance

### **Enterprise Security**
- Zero-trust network architecture
- IRSA for Kubernetes service accounts
- Comprehensive resource tagging
- Automated compliance checking

### **Cost Optimized**
- Right-sizing automation
- Reserved instance recommendations
- Cross-cloud cost arbitrage
- Real-time budget monitoring

### **Highly Available**
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Cross-region backup strategy
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- 99.9% uptime SLA

### Client Isolation
- **MTN Ghana**: Dedicated subnets, node groups, databases
- **Orange Madagascar**: Isolated infrastructure stack
- **Ezra Fintech**: Production-grade separation

### Resource Tagging Strategy
All resources include mandatory tags:
```hcl
tags = {
  Project         = "cptwn-eks-01"
  Environment     = "production"  
  CostCenter      = "infrastructure"
  BusinessUnit    = "platform"
  Owner           = "platform-team"
  ManagedBy       = "terraform"
}
```

### Security Controls
- âœ… All traffic encrypted in transit and at rest
- âœ… Network segmentation between clients
- âœ… Regular security scanning and updates
- âœ… Audit logging for all infrastructure changes

## ðŸ”§ Common Operations

### Deploy New Region
```bash
# Copy existing region structure
cp -r providers/aws/regions/af-south-1 providers/aws/regions/eu-west-1

# Update configurations and deploy
cd providers/aws/regions/eu-west-1/backend-setup
terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Add New Client
```bash
# Update foundation layer with client subnets
cd providers/aws/regions/af-south-1/layers/01-foundation/production
terraform plan -var="new_client_enabled=true"
terraform apply
```

### Scale Resources
```bash
# Scale EKS node groups
cd providers/aws/regions/af-south-1/layers/02-platform/production  
terraform plan -var="desired_size=6"  # Scale from 4 to 6 nodes
terraform apply
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Dashboards
- **Grafana**: Real-time infrastructure metrics
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Service health and performance
- **Cost Explorer**: Multi-cloud spend analysis
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for applications

### Alerting
- Budget variance > 10%
- Infrastructure deployment failures
- Security group changes
- High resource utilization (>80%)

## Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch**: Create branch for changes
2. **Local Testing**: Run `terraform plan` to validate
3. **Code Review**: Submit PR for team review
4. **Staging Deploy**: Test in non-production environment
5. **Production Deploy**: Apply changes with approval

### Best Practices
- Always run `terraform plan` before `apply`
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Tag all resources properly for cost tracking
- Document architectural decisions
- Test changes in development first
