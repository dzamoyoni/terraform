# Multi-Cloud Terraform Infrastructure

🌍 **Enterprise-grade multi-cloud infrastructure** built with Terraform for scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Team Members

1. **[📖 Team Onboarding Guide](docs/TEAM_ONBOARDING.md)** - Complete setup and your first deployment
2. **[🎯 Multi-Cloud Strategy](docs/MULTI_CLOUD_STRATEGY.md)** - Understand our architectural approach  
3. **[📋 Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - How to deploy and scale infrastructure
4. **[💰 FinOps & Cost Management](docs/FINOPS_COST_MANAGEMENT.md)** - Cost optimization strategies

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our infrastructure follows a **provider-centric, multi-cloud architecture**:

```
terraform/
├── providers/                  # Cloud provider deployments
│   ├── aws/                   # Amazon Web Services
│   │   ├── modules/           # AWS-specific modules
│   │   └── regions/           # Regional deployments
│   │       ├── af-south-1/    # Cape Town (Primary)
│   │       └── us-east-1/     # N. Virginia (Secondary) 
│   ├── gcp/                   # Google Cloud Platform (Planned)
│   └── azure/                 # Microsoft Azure (Planned)
├── modules/                   # Cloud-agnostic reusable modules
├── shared/                    # Cross-cloud configuration
└── docs/                      # Comprehensive documentation
```

### Layered Deployment Strategy

Each region deploys infrastructure in logical layers:

1. **🏢 Backend Setup** - Terraform state management (S3 + DynamoDB)
2. **🌐 Foundation (01)** - VPC, subnets, security groups, VPN
3. **☸️ Platform (02)** - EKS clusters, node groups, service accounts
4. **🗄️ Databases (03)** - PostgreSQL instances, backup systems
5. **📊 Observability (03.5)** - Monitoring, logging, distributed tracing
6. **🔧 Shared Services (06)** - Load balancers, DNS, cluster services

## 🌍 Current Deployments

### Production Infrastructure

| Region | Status | Purpose | Cluster | Nodes |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **af-south-1** (Cape Town) | ✅ Active | Primary | `cptwn-eks-01` | 4 |
| **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) | ✅ Active | Secondary | `us-east-1-cluster-01` | 4 |

### Multi-Cloud Roadmap

- **Q1**: AWS foundation complete (af-south-1, us-east-1)
- **Q2**: GCP expansion (europe-west1)
- **Q3**: Azure integration (westeurope)
- **Q4**: Advanced cross-cloud orchestration

- Auto-scaling based on demand
- 99.9% uptime SLA

## 📊 Infrastructure Metrics

### Current Scale
- **Total Resources**: 150+ managed by Terraform
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$3,500 across all regions
- **Utilization**: 75% average across compute resources
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime last 3 months

### Client Isolation
- **MTN Ghana**: Dedicated subnets, node groups, databases
- **Orange Madagascar**: Isolated infrastructure stack
- **Ezra Fintech**: Production-grade separation

## 🛡️ Governance & Compliance

### Resource Tagging Strategy
All resources include mandatory tags:
```hcl
tags = {
  Project         = "cptwn-eks-01"
  Environment     = "production"  
  CostCenter      = "infrastructure"
  BusinessUnit    = "platform"
  Owner           = "platform-team"
  ManagedBy       = "terraform"
}
```

### Security Controls
- ✅ All traffic encrypted in transit and at rest
- ✅ Network segmentation between clients
- ✅ Regular security scanning and updates
- ✅ Audit logging for all infrastructure changes

## 🔧 Common Operations

### Deploy New Region
```bash
# Copy existing region structure
cp -r providers/aws/regions/af-south-1 providers/aws/regions/eu-west-1

# Update configurations and deploy
cd providers/aws/regions/eu-west-1/backend-setup
terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Add New Client
```bash
# Update foundation layer with client subnets
cd providers/aws/regions/af-south-1/layers/01-foundation/production
terraform plan -var="new_client_enabled=true"
terraform apply
```

### Scale Resources
```bash
# Scale EKS node groups
cd providers/aws/regions/af-south-1/layers/02-platform/production  
terraform plan -var="desired_size=6"  # Scale from 4 to 6 nodes
terraform apply
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

### Dashboards
- **Grafana**: Real-time infrastructure metrics
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Service health and performance
- **Cost Explorer**: Multi-cloud spend analysis
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for applications

### Alerting
- Budget variance > 10%
- Infrastructure deployment failures
- Security group changes
- High resource utilization (>80%)

## 🤝 Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch**: Create branch for changes
2. **Local Testing**: Run `terraform plan` to validate
3. **Code Review**: Submit PR for team review
4. **Staging Deploy**: Test in non-production environment
5. **Production Deploy**: Apply changes with approval

### Best Practices
- Always run `terraform plan` before `apply`
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Tag all resources properly for cost tracking
- Document architectural decisions
- Test changes in development first
