# 🗄️ Database Layer - US-East-1 Production

## Database Infrastructure

This layer deploys database infrastructure for US-East-1.

### Architecture
- Project: `us-east-1-cluster-01`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Environment: `production`

### Client Database Isolation
- **Ezra Fintech Prod**: Dedicated database subnets and security groups
- **MTN Ghana Prod**: Dedicated database subnets and security groups

### Database Types
- PostgreSQL on EC2 (dedicated instances per client)
- RDS PostgreSQL (if required)
- Client-specific database configurations

### Dependencies
- Foundation Layer (01-foundation) must be deployed first
- Uses database subnets from foundation layer

### Next Steps
1. Create standardized database configurations
2. Implement client isolation patterns
3. Configure backup and monitoring
